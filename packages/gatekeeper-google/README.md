# Gatekeeper Google

This package provides Google OAuth integration for Gadgets, enabling gadgets to access Google APIs on behalf of users.

## Setting Up Google OAuth Credentials

If you're running this project locally and want to use Google API integrations, you'll need to create your own Google OAuth credentials. This guide walks you through the process step-by-step.

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click the project dropdown at the top of the page (it may say "Select a project" or show an existing project name)
4. Click **New Project** in the top-right of the popup
5. Enter a project name (e.g., "Gadgets Local Dev")
6. Click **Create**
7. Wait for the project to be created, then select it from the project dropdown

### Step 2: Enable Required APIs

You'll need to enable the Google APIs that you want to use. Currently supported: Gmail and Google Docs.

1. In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services** > **Library** (or [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library))
2. Search for "Gmail API"
3. Click on **Gmail API** in the results
4. Click **Enable**
5. Go back to the Library, search for "Google Docs API"
6. Click on **Google Docs API** in the results
7. Click **Enable**

### Step 3: Configure the OAuth Consent Screen

Before creating credentials, you must configure how the consent screen appears to users.

1. In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services** > **OAuth consent screen** (or [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent))
2. Select **External** as the user type (unless you have a Google Workspace organization and want to restrict to internal users only)
3. Click **Create**
4. Fill in the App Information:
   - **App name**: Enter anything (e.g., "Gadgets Local Dev")
   - Details are largely optional / irrelevant here, since this app will run it testing mode.
   - Click **Save and Continue**
5. On the Scopes page, you can just click **Save and Continue** without adding anything. The scopes are specified by the OAuth request itself, not the console configuration. (The console's scope UI is only relevant if you later want to publish your app for Google's verification review.)

### Step 4: Test Users

This is important! While your app is in "Testing" mode (which it will be by default), only users you explicitly add here can use OAuth.

1. Click **Add Users**
2. Enter your own Google email address (the one you'll use to test Google API integrations)
3. Click **Add**
4. Click **Save and Continue**
5. Review the summary and click **Back to Dashboard**

### Step 5: Create OAuth Credentials

1. In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials** (or [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials))
2. Click **Create Credentials** at the top
3. Select **OAuth client ID**
4. For **Application type**, select **Web application**
5. **Name**: Enter anything (e.g., "Gadgets Local")
6. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, click **Add URI** and enter: `http://localhost:8787/gatekeeper/google/oauth`
7. Click **Create**

A popup will appear with your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Keep this window open or copy these values somewhere safe.

### Step 6: Configure Your Local Environment

Create a `.env` file in this package's directory (`packages/gatekeeper-google/.env`):

```bash
CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com
CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
```

Replace the values with the credentials from Step 4.

> **Note**: The `.env` file is gitignored and should never be committed.

### Step 7: Verify Setup

1. Start the application in dev mode (see instructions in the root README.md).
2. Create or open a gadget.
3. Navigate to the **Connections** tab.
4. Click **+ New Connection**.
5. For the URL, enter: `https://mail.google.com/`
6. Click **Next**.
7. You will be prompted to connect an account. Click **Google**.
8. You should be redirected to Google's consent screen in a new tab.
9. The consent screen acts extra-scary since this is an "unverified" test app.
10. After granting access, the tab closes, and you're back to Gadgets.
11. If you successfully authorized, the Google account you just added should appear under **Your Accounts**. Click it.
12. You now have a `GMAIL_INBOX` binding. Ask the agent what it can do, or ask it to write a gadget using it.

You can also see your connected accounts and add and remove them in the settings (accessed through the account menu in the upper-right).

## Troubleshooting

### "redirect_uri_mismatch" error

This means the redirect URI in your OAuth credentials doesn't match what the app is sending. Double-check that you added exactly `http://localhost:8787/gatekeeper/google/oauth` (no trailing slash, http not https) to your OAuth client's Authorized redirect URIs.

### "access_denied" error

Common causes:
- **You're not a test user**: While the app is in Testing mode, only users listed in the OAuth consent screen's Test Users can authenticate. Add your email there.
- **You denied consent**: Try again and click "Allow" on Google's consent screen.

### "invalid_client" error

Your CLIENT_ID or CLIENT_SECRET is incorrect. Double-check the values in your `.env` file match exactly what's shown in the Google Cloud Console.

### OAuth consent screen shows "unverified app" warning

This is normal for apps in Testing mode. Click "Advanced" and then "Go to [app name] (unsafe)" to proceed. This warning only appears for test users during development.

### "This app is blocked" or quota errors

You may have hit rate limits or your project may have issues. Check the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) for any alerts or quota warnings on your project.
